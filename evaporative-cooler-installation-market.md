<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Cooler Installation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Downdraft</li><li>Sidedraft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The evaporative cooler installation market can be categorized into two primary types: downdraft and sidedraft coolers. Downdraft coolers operate by drawing in hot air from the top and cooling it as it descends through a wet media pad, providing efficient cooling for larger spaces. In contrast, sidedraft coolers pull air from the sides, allowing for versatile placement and effective cooling in smaller or restricted areas. Both types serve distinct applications, catering to different cooling needs and environments.</p></p>
